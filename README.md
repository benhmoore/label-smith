This is a work-in-progress project to aid with labeling documents for fine-tuning operations.

The project is split into three packages:

- A root package that orchestrates the client and server
- A Vite.js client application, which describes the user interface
- An Express.js server application, which handles file system and database operations.

Run `npm run install-all` to install all dependencies.
Run `npm run start` to start the application.

The `./dropbox` directory will be used to import files into the application.
